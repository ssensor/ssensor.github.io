[YOffleNet Deep Sort in PyTorch](https://github.com/hkim1207/2021MIP)

This repository contains a modified version of  Pytorch YOLOv3 + Deep Sort (https://github.com/mikel-brostrom/Yolov3_DeepSort_Pytorch). It is a program that counts the number of people and predicts the direction of movement using the bounding box coordinates obtained by tracking algorithm.

This project was carried out as a 2021-1 MIP by H.J. Kim
